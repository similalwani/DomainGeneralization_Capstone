# Localizing the origin of ventricular activation from 12-Lead ECG using Domain Generalization
The aim of this project is to develop a domain generalized model to localize the origin of ventricular contractions, using domain invariant patient data generalized and adapted using DANN (Domain Adversarial Neural Network). DANN perfoms better than Vanilla classifier. I've further implemented Maximum Mean Discrepancy to improve genralization. 

## Dataset:
Dataset cannot be made public, so I've provided the executed code with outputs in an .ipynb file. The dataset consists of clinical and simulated ECG data.
